## Welcome to the new HOME for the corkobservatories.org website
The original [corkobservatories.org](http://mercury.uvic.ca/~corks/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage) never really got adopted and is pretty outdated, now. We also tried out [Goolge Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/corkobservatories/) and were not all that convinced. Now, [we are deciding](https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories.github.io/issues/1) if we should move corkobservatories.org here...

Pages could be quickly drafted in the local [Wiki](https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories.github.io/wiki) and when ready published on the [www.corkobservatories.org](https://corkobservatories.github.io/) webpage (would need to link the domain).


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/corkobservatories/corkobservatories.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
